            Overtime Athletes have begun to step outside the box of their
            respective fields to pursue another business acumen, whether its
            IPO’s, investing in start-ups or starting digital media companies, a
            defining change has transcended the sports world for years to come.
            Traditionally, athletes are pigeon-holed and are defined by what
            they do in their sport. Now in the ripe year of 2020, the culture of
            sport + business has evolved tremendously.

            Several professional athletes like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and
            Kyrie Irving have set the standards for building a business to grow
            for your post-career. Whether it’s setting up a digital media
            network in Uninterrupted, or developing an investment portfolios
            like ThirtyFiveVentures, or launching a video content platform in
            PlayersTV. The day in professional sports will come when athletes
            will make decisions that set them up for years to come. The average
            NBA career is 4.5 years, which is one NBA contract. The reality is
            that the future of pro sports will change, forcing the athletes to
            start thinking about post-career options. As the career goals of
            star athletes begin to change, they must think about what their
            future entails.

            The implications of the global pandemic have changed the way our
            sports and entertainment business will run for years to come. With
            the exclusion of fan experiences, virtual events and meetings, its
            time for athletes to think creatively and fund their passions
            outside the sport. Here’s a glimpse of notable professionals
            athletes or what I like to phrase the term “Athlete-Preneur” and
            some of their business acumen off the court. Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant
            has used his time off the court to focus on his business in New York
            City.
